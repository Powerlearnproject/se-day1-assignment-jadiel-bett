#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a discipline that applies engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. It aids the Technology industry by creating software applications and systems that power various sectors i.e commerce, communication, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The development of programming languages such as C and Fortran.
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 60s.
3. The introduction of structured programming in the 70s.
4. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements - Here, the system requirements are gathered and documented
2. Design - A high-level and detailed design is created
3. Implementation - Involves coding and building the software based on the specifications
4. Testing - Various tests, i.e unit and integration tests are done to ensure quality and standards are met
5. Deployment - Involves releasing the software to users and customers
6. Maintenance - Continuous support and updates to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

- Waterfall methodology involves a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall, whereas Agile methodology implores an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
- Waterfall is better suited for projects that must meet strict regulations and require deliverables for each phase before proceeding to the next. Agile however is suited for fast moving teams experimenting with direction and don't necessarily know the final project will look like.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- The Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing the software solution.
- Quality Assurance Engineer designs and executes test plans to guarantee software quality
- Project Manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

- IDEs like Visual Studio and Eclipse provide tools for writing, debugging, and testing code.
- Version Control Systems e.g Git, Subversion, are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinatinf work among team members.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

- Changing requirements during the development cycle lead to scope creep and project delays
- Tight deadlines increase pressure on developers leading ro rushed development and compromised quality
- Technical debt accrued from shortcuts tends to impede future development and increase maintenance costs

The above challenges may be mitigated by ensuring effective communication, employing agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular assessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

- Unit test involves testing individual software components or modules
- Integration test involves testing the interaction between different components or subsystems
- System test involves testing the entire software system as a whole
- Acceptance test involves testing the software system against user requirements to determine if it meets user needs.

Overall, these tests are important in identifying and fixing defects early in production leading to higher quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering involves crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from AI models. It helps improve the interactions between humans and AI by ensuring the AI responses are clear and helpful.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

A vague prompt could be, "Tell me how to make an app". Here that LLM might give various general answers. However, an improved prompt such as, "Tell me how to make a Chat app using Flutter" would result in a more concise and better response from the model. The improved effectiveness is because the second prompt gives parameters such as "Chat app", and "Flutter" that help narrow the scope for the LLM's response.
